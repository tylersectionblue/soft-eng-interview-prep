## Add/Remove Topic

Do you want to add a new topic, or think that an existing topic is out of scope? Please [open an issue](https://github.com/orrsella/soft-eng-interview-prep/issues) and let's discuss. I tried to limit the scope of this summary to what I think are the essentials (topics that are a bit out of scope but I find important are labeled as advanced).
